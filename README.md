# Team-Tastic

Team-Tastic (the team machine) is a simple team profile generator built with node.js. Use the command line to create a beautifully formatted team roster of your software engineering team. Add positions such as a Manager, Engineers, and Interns and feature information such as email addresses, GitHub usernames, and employee ids.

## How to Install
You must first clone this repository onto your local machine, cd into the root folder of team-machine and run `npm install`. 


## How to Use
While in the root folder run `node index.js` to start the application. You will be prompted to enter information about your team roster. Enter the information and hit enter for each prompt until you are done building your roster. See the [Walkthrough-Video](#walkthrough-video)
Once you choose "Finished" your finished materials will be found in the dist folder. Your team roster will look similar to the following:
